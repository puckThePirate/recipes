    <p>Paneer is a fresh, non-aged cheese that is made by curdling hot milk with a food acid like lemon juice or vinegar. The curdled and coagulated milk particles are collected in a muslin to drain the extra whey. Either the muslin bundle is kept under
        a heavy weighted object or it is hung over a hook or the kitchen sink faucet handle for the whey to be drained.</p>
